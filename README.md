v2 is coming soon. It will be finished before UTM winter semester starts.

If you need it, please visit the archive code of the v1 branch.

The v2 version will be very different from v1. I will split it into a raw csv processing program specifically adapted for Timberborn and a general csvai translator that supports command line and GUI.

This is more in line with my original intention: a universal translator.
